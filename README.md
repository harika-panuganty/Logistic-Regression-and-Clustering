# Logistic-Regression-and-Clustering

The fourth project for my Intermediate Applied Data Analysis class from the MscBMI Program at The University of Chicago included Logistic Regression, Cross-Validation, Hierarchial & K-Means clustering. The code for this repository elaborates on the specific code used to answer questions from the aforementioned topics.

Section 1: To implement a Logistic Regression using R function GLM, the data was first split using R function caret and the continuous variables were formatted as categorical. To see the results, a confusion matrix was used. 

Section 2: This section involved writing code to perform a three fold cross-validation on the above mentioned trained dataset. To measure accuracy of the prediction, AUC and 95%CI values were calculated. 

Section 3: This section explored Hierarchial Clustering and its types -- both scaled & unscaled Average Linkage, Complete Linkage and Euclidean. 

Section 4: Along with the code for K-Means clustering, this section taught to seek pertinent information from the plots along with understanding how to select the best value for K.
